MitsunekoLucky

This is the fan project where we have the following objectives:

- Set up an output where it's easy to setup for everyone who wants to use this project to have English text displayed in-game.
- Grab json and other resources automatically from DMM server and add into this project's database.
- Once we have a working build, we can test by porting ALL text displayed from Nutaku/Johren to DMM first, we then translate whatever's not translated.
- Translations are to be machine translated first until we have a proper translation, automated script translations is highly recommended.
- Any willing translators and proofreaders to assist is appreciated.
- Test to ensure text displays properly and report bugs.
- Port Wiki translated text into these json files.
- (Optional) use an image editor to make english versions of titles.
